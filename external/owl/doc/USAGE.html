<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>Each tool accepts specific command line options, which can be listed via <code>--help</code>. Additionally, the following set of common options is understood by all tools. Due to implementation details, grouping of the options is necessary, i.e. all global options have to be specified first, followed by all input options, and finally tool-specific options can be given.</p>
<p><strong>Global options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>-v</code> or <code>--version</code>: Print the name of the tool an the version.</li>
<li><code>--annotations</code>: Gather additional, human-readable information where possible. For example, the <code>ltl2ldba</code> and <code>ltl2dgra</code> constructions will gather a readable representation of the semantic state labels created by the construction.</li>
<li><code>-i INPUT</code>: Pass <code>INPUT</code> as input to the tool</li>
<li><code>-I FILE</code>: Pass the contents of <code>FILE</code> to the tool</li>
<li><code>-O FILE</code>: Write the output to <code>FILE</code></li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="FORMATS.html">format descriptions</a> for a description of accepted inputs. Additionally, as soon as an unmatched argument is encountered, this and all following arguments will be interpreted as input. For example, <code>ltl2dpa "F G a"</code> is equivalent to <code>ltl2dpa -i "F G a"</code>.</p>
<h2 id="extended-command-line-syntax">Extended command line syntax</h2>
<p>Owl comes with a flexible command line interface intended to aid rapid development and prototyping of various constructions, explained here. To give full control over the translation process to the user, it offers a verbose, modular way of specifying a particular tool-chain. This is achieved by means of multiple building blocks, which are connected together to create the desired translation. These "building blocks" come in three different flavours, namely input parsers, transformers, and output writers, all of which are pluggable and extensible.</p>
<p>These three blocks are, as their names suggest, responsible for parsing input, applying operations to objects, and serializing the results to the desired format, respectively. We refer to a sequence of a parser, multiple transformers and an output writer as "pipeline".</p>
<p>Once configured, a pipeline is passed to an executor, which sets up the input/output behaviour and actually executing the pipeline. Usually, users will be content with reading from standard input or a file, which is handled by the default executor <code>owl</code>. Other possibilities, like a network server, will be mentioned later.</p>
<h3 id="basic-usage">Basic usage</h3>
<p>This approach is explained through a simple, incremental example. To begin with, we chain an LTL parser to the <code>ltl2dpa</code> construction and output the resulting automaton in the HOA format by</p>
<pre><code>% owl  ltl --- ltl2dpa --- hoa
</code></pre>
<p>Fixed input can be specified with <code>-i "&lt;input&gt;"</code>, while <code>-I "&lt;input.file&gt;"</code> reads the given file. For example:</p>
<pre><code>% owl -i &quot;F G a&quot; ltl --- ltl2dpa --- hoa
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, output is written to a file with <code>-O "&lt;output.file&gt;"</code></p>
<p>To additionally pre-process the input formula and minimize the result automaton, one simply adds more transformers to the pipeline</p>
<pre><code>% owl  ltl --- simplify-ltl --- ltl2dpa --- minimize-aut --- hoa
</code></pre>
<p>For research purposes, one may be interested in what exactly happens during the intermediate steps, for example how the rewritten formula looks like, or how large the automaton is prior to the minimization. This data could be obtained by executing several different configurations, which is cumbersome and time-consuming for large data-sets. Instead, a seamless meta-data collection during the execution process is offered. For example, to obtain the above numbers in one execution, write</p>
<pre><code>% owl  ltl --- simplify-ltl --- string --- ltl2dpa --- aut-stat --format &quot;%S/%C/%A&quot; --- minimize-aut --- hoa
</code></pre>
<p>Owl will now output the rewritten formula plus the amount of states, number of SCCs and number of acceptance sets for each input to <code>stderr</code> (by default).</p>
<h3 id="extending-the-framework">Extending the Framework</h3>
<p>Often, a researcher might not only be interested in how the existing operations performs, but rather how a new implementation behaves. By simply delegating to an external translator, existing implementations can easily be integrated in such a pipeline. For example, translation can be delegated to Rabinizer 3.1 by</p>
<pre><code>% owl  ltl --- simplify-ltl --- ltl2aut-ext --tool &quot;run-rabinizer.sh %f&quot; --- minimize-aut --- hoa
</code></pre>
<h3 id="server-mode">Server Mode</h3>
<p>The <em>server mode</em> listens on a given address and port for incoming TCP connections. Each of these connections then is handled as a separate pair of input source / output sink, i.e. the specified input parser reads from each connection and the resulting outputs are written back to the client, all completely transparent to the translation modules. For example, a <code>ltl2dpa</code> server is started by writing <code>% owl-server  ltl --- simplify-ltl --- ltl2dpa --- hoa</code> Sending input is as easy as <code>nc localhost 5050</code> and starting to type. This allows easy usage as a fast back-end server, since the JVM does not have to start for each input.</p>
